Well the cool thing is you <em>can</em> access all these things with all the new device api’s that are now supported<br>in browsers. You can now swing your magic wand and give your PWA even more of that “native” feel by accessing the capabilities of the users device<br>all from plain JavaScript!</p>
<h4 id="Why-would-I-want-to-access-these-native-capabilities"><a href="#Why-would-I-want-to-access-these-native-capabilities" class="headerlink" title="Why would I want to access these native capabilities?"></a>Why would I want to access these native capabilities?</h4><p>To answer this question we first have to take a look at exactly what a PWA is. If you dont know already a PWA is a web app built with<br>modern web technologies such as service workers, web manifests and more that give a fast, app-like experience in the browser. And, if the user decides<br>they like your PWA and visit it enough times then they will get a prompt to add it to their homescreen on their device which puts your PWA<br>right alongside all the native apps on their device! Now the two key things here are <em>app-like</em> and <em>right alongside all the native apps on their<br>device</em>. When your PWA sits right alongside native apps and launches just like a native app (no browser chrome) a user has the expectation that<br>your PWA will act and feel just like a native app. A key part of this is being able to access the same device functionality that a native app<br>can access. A good example of this is sharing something on Android. There is a standard way that sharing happens on Android and all native apps will<br>use this same api for sharing something which means that a user will get used to this way of sharing something from their device. Now, if they are using<br>your PWA, hit a share button and are all the sudden faced with an unfamiliar sharing ui then it can cause confusion, therefore causing the user<br>to potentially not want to use your PWA.</p>
<h4 id="Ok-so-now-I-want-to-use-these-api’s-but-what-is-actually-available"><a href="#Ok-so-now-I-want-to-use-these-api’s-but-what-is-actually-available" class="headerlink" title="Ok so now I want to use these api’s, but what is actually available?"></a>Ok so now I want to use these api’s, but what is actually available?</h4><p>The cool thing about the modern web is that it is immensely powerful and has more access to your device than you may think. Here is a short list<br>of some of what is available out there now: <em>disclaimer - not all of these api’s are widely supported yet but are standardized and should be coming soon</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Vibration api - <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=vibration" target="_blank" rel="external">http://caniuse.com/#feat=vibration</a></li>
<li>GetUserMedia api - <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=getUserMedia" target="_blank" rel="external">http://caniuse.com/#search=getUserMedia</a></li>
<li>Web Share api - Only available as an <a href="https://github.com/jpchase/OriginTrials/blob/gh-pages/developer-guide.md" target="_blank" rel="external">origin trial</a> in Chrome at the moment</li>
<li>Battery Status api - <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=battery-status" target="_blank" rel="external">http://caniuse.com/#feat=battery-status</a></li>
<li>Push messages api - <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=push" target="_blank" rel="external">http://caniuse.com/#search=push</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For a comprehensive list feel free to check out <a href="https://whatwebcando.today/" target="_blank" rel="external">What web can do today</a> but these are some of what I personally think<br>are the coolest device api’s available at the moment. As you can see the browser support is pretty decent for most of these api’s. Happily, edge is in the<br>progress of implementing most of these (understandable as they are still a relatively new browser) which just leaves Safari not having good support, I have<br>hope that Safari will implement these api’s soon though!</p>

Have any examples available I can use?"></a>This is exciting! Have any examples available I can use?</h4><p>Over the coming weeks I hope to create a few PWA’s that use these api’s and open source them on Github for you to use as examples!</p>
<p>Thanks for checking out what is only my second blog post on this blog! I have a special blog post planned next that I think you will want to see!<br>Think its possible to create a full blown camera app only out of web technologies? It definitely is and in my next post I will go over how I did this!</p>
